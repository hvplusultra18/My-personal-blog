<p>So the first week was pretty smooth(well, almostðŸ˜…) and the courses seemed quite interesting.</p>


<p>I am especially excited about the intro to psychology course since this is my first ever tryst with the subject. The others had concepts which were a bit familiar to me so even though I am excited, it's just not as much as I am for this course</p>
