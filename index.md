title: "An interesting paradox."
---

If a person comes back in time to teach me about time travel who himself had learnt it from the future me, where is the origin of this information?
You all must have heard about the grandfatehr paradox. For those who haven't it goes like this:
"If time travel is possible, and if you go back in time, if you kill your grandfather, how did your existance come about in teh first place?" 
Now there are many theories explaining this paradox such as alternate timelines, existence of a multiverse where travelling through space is euivalent to travelling through time etc, one such theory which appealed to me was the theory that the past can't be altered, no matter what you do. Which means that even if you go back to the time before your parents were born and attempt to kill your grandfather, you cannot. There must have been an incident which prevented this from happening thus protcting your existence and consequently, preventing potential disasters(the butterfly effect:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). This theory as used in the plot for the German Netflix webseries "DARK" where the protagonist tries to alter the present by makig some changes in the future but fails to do so because of this phenomenon.
Hope you enjoyed it.
Arigatho!
